## Introduction

`cal-lunisolar` is a GNU Emacs package for the Traditional East Asian lunisolar calendar. Emacs version of localization for China, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan and countries in the East Asian cultural sphere. â€” Edit

The package is still under-develepment.

(add-to-list 'load-path
	     "path/to/the/directory/of/cal-lunisolar")
```

#### aligning CJK and ASCII fonts

For aligning CJK and ASCII font, [chinese-fonts-setup](https://github.com/tumashu/chinese-fonts-setup) may be helpful.

> If you have  installed [chinese-fonts-setup](https://github.com/tumashu/chinese-fonts-setup), 
```elisp
(setq cal-lunisolar-force-align nil)  ;; default 
```
> If you have not installed [chinese-fonts-setup](https://github.com/tumashu/chinese-fonts-setup), you can set `cal-lunisolar-force-align` to `t` which will try to align the date entries. Currently I have assumed there are only 2 CJK characters in each date entry.
```elisp
(setq cal-lunisolar-force-align t)
```
